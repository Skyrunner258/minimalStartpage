# minimalStartpage
This is my personal startpage. I am still new to web development, so I'm sure some things could be done a bit better. 

The image(s) on the webpage can be changed by simply adding the files and replacing the file names in index.html and imageSwitcher.js
When clicked, the image will switch between the two chosen images.
